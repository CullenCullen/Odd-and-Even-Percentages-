# Odd-and-Even-Percentages-

Technologies: Python

This program calculates how many values in a list of randomly generated integers are odd and how many are even 
with the following requirements: 
The user inputs the number of values to be generated and the range of the values. *Range always begins at 1.
After calculating the total number of odd and even values, the program will display the results and allow the 
user to continue to generate and count new sets of values until they choose to exit.
